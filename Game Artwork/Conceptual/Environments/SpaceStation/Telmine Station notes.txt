Telmine Space Station. The basic idea of many designs for artificial gravity are centered on using centrifugal force to stick people to the outside of a structure. I ran with that idea here, creating two large wheels for the visitors to enjoy, with some slightly less logical constructions (like the biodomes) to suggest that technology here exceeds our own. 

However, some familiar technology shows up in the form of solar panels. This is because I think the idea of racing across solar panels in space seemed really exciting to me, and I wanted to bring that suggestion into this concept. 

The description of the space station describes a course that travels through many different space station sections. I like this idea, but as the thing came together, it ended up being a very large structure; believably so, though. I can imagine it being used for multiple courses, with each going through or on a different part.
