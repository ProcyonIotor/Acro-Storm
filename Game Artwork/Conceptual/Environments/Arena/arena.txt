For the arena, the description left a bit to the imagination. But with the concept of a domed roof, I ran with the idea of a geodessic style dome enclosing the whole thing. Once that was in place, though, I realized that a well-built dome made of future-tech materials doesn't need to just protect people against rain.
So why not put it underwater? Or hurtling through unprotected space? Or in the center of a burning sun?
Changing what's viewed through the glass ends up having a huge effect on the ambiance of the scene, for me, so that's the idea I wanted to get across.

Otherwise, two tracks present in the arena, a simple oval, and a figure eight with a barrel-roll built in.
