My idea for the underwater section of this track was that the player would be riding through a tube that cut through the middle of a kelp forest. Do a google image search if you are interested, they really have a unique charm to them.

Since I drew the location at night, and since this influenced a lot of the look, the ocean here is much darker than what you'll find on google images. I left a little bit of surface glow, since the town would probably light things up a little bit, and I tried to show that there was the equivalent of neon tubes built into the support beam in the roof there.

I do like the round windows of the design used in the youtube video, but I don't have anything to add to that design, and besides, I wanted particularly to show off the outside of the tunnels for this, so I used the tube design I had originally come up with. It's basically just a glass tube, with three supports, held in place by cement arches, with some sort of force-field floor.
