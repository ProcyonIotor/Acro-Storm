Bike Types / Listing

In the game, there will be three types of bikes: Sport, Cruisers, and Pocket. Each type of bike can be rode by any character, but the stats will vary depending on the type of bike.

Sport Bikes- Sport bikes are the average style of bikes, being generally good all-around workhorses. Top Speed, Accel, Handling, and Power are generally about average, and each Sport bike generally has one or two stats which they're slightly above average in. 

Cruiser Bikes- Crusier bikes are generally the faster types of bikes with a strong body, but they tend to have poorer handling and accelerate slowly. Cruiser bikes are generally a bit larger framewise, and have larger thrusters.

Pocket Bikes- Pocket bikes are generally slightly smaller than normal, but have excellent acceleration rates and handling. They tend to lack power or a very high top speed, however. Mostly have slightly smaller frames, and built for aerodynamics to an impressive degree.

Customization: Bike are generally made up of four parts: Base, Head, Wings, and Rear. Only the Base is what matters, stat wise. All else is for cosmetic purposes.
