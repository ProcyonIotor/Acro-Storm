have a central MySQL database for user registrations (do NOT store stats in this one). This basically holds the user's information -- the "gamer tag", 
their email, their name, etc., etc. depending on what you want (and also an auto-increment ID). 
Then you can have a -stats- database that stores user's stats based on their ID.

Finally, you can have another mysql database to store active hosts (like GameSpy does).When a user Creates a game, their IP and ID will be added to the active hosts database. 
Find Game will automatically find the best match (or if you want, just display all and let the user pick).
Make sure you don't send the password to login in plain-text. At least use MD5. ;)
So the database will store the MD5 hash of the pass, not the actual pass.
or AES, or anything you want, just be secure about it
